# Dark Theme Switcher

Forked from [anjalbinayak/dark-theme-switcher](https://github.com/anjalbinayak/dark-theme-switcher)

## Why did I fork it?

I really like the idea behind this project, but that button floating at the screen looks boring to me.

Next days, I'll be working here on my free time to change that behavior and analyse the code better.

## Already done

- [x] Initialize npm
- [x] Start using TypeScript
- [x] Update code according to ES2020
